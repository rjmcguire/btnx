btnx: Button Extension- a daemon for sending keyboard and mouse
combination events when pressing mouse buttons.

btnx will only work for supported mice. You can find a list of supported
mice in the SUPPORTED_MICE file.

btnx is a daemon that sniffs events from the mouse event handler.
If it recognizes a configured event, it sends a keyboard and/or mouse
combination event to uinput. This means you can configure certain
mouse buttons to send keyboard and mouse events to X.

It is useful for mice with more buttons than window managers can
handle. It also means you won't need to manually edit your window
manager and X configurations to get additional functionality from
extra buttons.

The configuration file for btnx is located at /etc/btnx/btnx_config.
On the first run, btnx should detect your mouse and copy its default
configuration file from the /etc/btnx/defaults directory to btnx_config.
You can then edit the btnx_config file to send whatever events you
want for certain mouse buttons. The /etc/btnx/events file contains all
the possible keyboard and mouse events you can send. The btnx_config
file should have plenty of instructions for editing button 
configurations.
After changing the config file, make sure to restart btnx by running:
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/btnx restart
