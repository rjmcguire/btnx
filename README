btnx: Button Extension- a daemon for sending keyboard and mouse
combination events when pressing mouse buttons.

Author: Olli Salonen <oasalonen@gmail.com>


btnx is a daemon that sniffs events from the mouse event handler.
If it recognizes a configured event, it sends a keyboard and/or mouse
combination event to uinput. This means you can configure certain
mouse buttons to send keyboard and mouse events to your system with or without X.

It is useful for mice with more buttons than window managers can
handle. It also means you won't need to manually edit your window
manager and X configurations to get additional functionality from
extra buttons.

The configuration files for btnx are located at /etc/btnx.
The configuration file is edited with btnx-config. You must install
and run btnx-config before btnx will work.
After changing the config file, make sure to restart btnx in btnx-config
or by running

$ sudo /etc/init.d/btnx restart
