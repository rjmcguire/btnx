Installation instructions:
If you are upgrading your btnx, you don't have
to uninstall first. Installation will make a
backup of your previous configuration file.

-------------------------------------
Ubuntu (possibly Debian as well):

$ make
$ sudo make install

Uninstall:

$ sudo make uninstall

-------------------------------------

Other distros:
bntx will not autostart on boot when following
these instructions. If your distro comes with
the update-rc.d utility and runlevels are
defined as they are in Ubuntu (2-5 runlevels
are all treated the same), you can use the
Ubuntu installation instructions.

$ make
Then, as root:
# make install-generic

Uninstall:
# make uninstall-generic

Run (as root):
# ./btnx
