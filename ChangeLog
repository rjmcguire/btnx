btnx ChangeLog

2008-04-30	v.0.4.11
	* Fixes multiple process bug, caused by incorrect pid file removal.

2008-04-28	v.0.4.10
	* Fixes unhandled read exception when a button handler closes. Lead to an 
	infinite loop. Occurred when mouse went to sleep or was unplugged.
	Fixes bug #223397: https://bugs.launchpad.net/btnx/+bug/223397

2008-04-05	v.0.4.9
	* Fixes combination release issue. Modifiers were released before the main
	key which caused the system to register extra main keys during release.
	* Incorporates configuration looping: btnx tries all configuration files
	until it detects a configured mouse. This means you can have multiple
	configurations with different mice and btnx will start with the one
	plugged in (good for roaming users). If many mice are plugged in, btnx
	uses the highest priority one.
	Fixes bug #200050: https://bugs.launchpad.net/btnx/+bug/200050
	* Better structure for listening to multiple device handlers.
	* Allows use of devices with only absolute x,y axis movement. Previously
	the mouse was detected according to only relative x,y setting values. Allows
	the use of touchpads.

2008-03-12	v.0.4.8
	* btnx requires libdaemon >= v.0.10.
	* Daemon functionality (PID file, output and logging, signals) handled more
	gracefully by libdaemon.
	* Refinement of ./configure script. Arguments:
	init_scripts_path = control init scripts path argument.
	config_path = path where btnx configuration files are stored.
	init_tool = set to no to disable init script registration. Otherwise,
	autodetects update-rc.d, chkconfig, and rc-update.
	output_syslog = set to yes to make btnx redirect output to syslog when
	started by the init script.

2008-03-06	v.0.4.7
	* btnx has been converted to use GNU autotools. Use ./configure before
	running make and install. See ./configure --help for additional
	arguments.
	* Compatible with btnx-config v. >= 0.4.7
	* Kernel 2.6.24 input interface changes required changes to reading
	the configuration data and reading event handlers.
	* Reads event handlers like it should have since the beginning.

2008-02-21	v.0.4.6
	* Added some more delay after modifier key press. Too short delay caused
	mouse button keycodes to be registered on some systems before modifier 
	keys. Resulted in combos not working properly.
	Fixes bug #193262: https://bugs.launchpad.net/btnx/+bug/193262

2008-01-03	v.0.4.5
	* Allows double-clicking by manually changing a button event type=1. This
	undocumented feature was blocked by the force release property.

2007-12-11	v.0.4.4
	* Fixed "2" file creation bug in init script.

2007-12-10	v.0.4.3
	* Init script stop command uses btnx to kill all processes. Previous
	implementation lead to race conditions between init script and btnx
	processes to read and kill PIDs. Also lead to duplicate btnx processes.
	Fixes bug #175088: https://bugs.launchpad.net/btnx/+bug/175088

2007-12-08	v.0.4.2
	* Fixed PID file bug. kill_pids() closed file descriptor that append_pid()
	required to append the PID of current process. Resulted in duplicate btnx
	processes.

2007-12-05	v.0.4.1
	* Init script fix: do_start() attempts to start btnx with full path and
	on failure, attempts to start it with just the executable name. Necessary
	for different implementations of start_daemon().
	* Init script fix: log_*_msg removed, replaced with echoes
	* Init script fix: checks for existence of event handlers before allowing
	btnx to be started.
	* These should fix the delay during boot that some users have experienced.

2007-11-29	v.0.4.0
	* Compatible with btnx-config 0.4.0
	* Added support for multiple configurations.
	* Allows switching configurations with a button event.
	Restarts itself with the correct configuration.
	* Locks PID file while writing and reading it during start up.
	* Kills all previous btnx processes found in the PID file during start up.
	* Support for "Force immediate button release" setting. Sends an immediate
	button release signal after the button pressed signal. Buttons with this
	option cannot be held down.

2007-11-11	v.0.3.3
	* Init bug fixes.
	* LSB compliant init scripts.
	* Forks to background using daemon() with command line argument -b.
	* Log file output with command line argument -l.
	* Appends PID to PID file.

2007-10-15	v.0.3.2
	* Integrated revoco.
	* Command line argument support.

2007-08-12	v.0.3.1
	* Support for hotplugging.
	* Updated Makefile (no more generic installation targets).
	* Removed deprecated default configuration files.

2007-07-06	v.0.3.0
	* First release of the new btnx.
	* Deprecates the v.0.2.x operation model, it is no longer maintained. No
	more hexdumps will be accepted or added to v.0.2.x.
	* No more automatic device detection or device hexdumps. The mouse and
	its buttons are detected and by btnx-config. No more text file editing.
	* Dependent btnx-config

2007-07-06	v.0.2.14
	* Final release of the old btnx branch.
