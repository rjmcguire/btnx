#	Basic structure of a button configuration for sending
#	keyboard and button events
#   -------------------------------------------------------
#	Button
#	rawcode = 0x00000000
#	type	= 0
#	keycode	= KEY
#	mod1	= KEY
#	mod2	= KEY
#	mod3	= KEY
#	EndButton
#
#
#	Basic structure of a button configuration for command
#	execution
#   -------------------------------------------------------
#	Button
#	rawcode = 0x00000000
#	type	= 0
#	command = /path/to/file_name arg1 arg2 ... argN
#	uid		= 1000
#	EndButton
#
#
#
#	Description of the structure
#	-------------------------------------------------------
#	The configuration field for a button must be started by
#	a "Button" line and closed by an "EndButton" line. Inside
#	the configuration you MUST specify:
#		- rawcode
#		- type
#		- keycode OR command
#
#	The mod[1..3] fields are optional. The fields have the
#	following meanings:
#
#	rawcode: the byte stream sent to an event handler by the
#	mouse driver, used to identify the button. It must be a
#	32-bit base16 (hexadecimal) value preceded by "0x". You
#	probably should not change this value at all.
#
#	type: the type of event the button sends.
#	(Preset for your specific mouse buttons.)
#	If pressing the button sends a button press signal and
#	releasing it sends a release signal, the type is 0.
#	If pressing the button sends both press and release signals
#	simultaneously, the type is 1.
#	-This is usually necessary for mouse wheel events.
#
#	keycode: this is the actual value of the key or button to
#	send when the mouse button is pressed. Have a look at the
#	events file (located at /etc/btnx/events) for all possible
#	values. You can use any key (KEY_*) or button (BTN_*) events
#	in that file. The events beginning with KEY_ are for simulating
#	keyboard events and the events beginning with BTN_ are for
#	simulating mouse button events. Not all of them are handled by
#	X. You must use the string describing the event! Not the number.
#		-Special note: REL_WHEELFORWARD and REL_WHEELBACK are for
#		sending mouse wheel scroll events.
#
#	mod[1..3]: these are modifier key values. Examples are
#	shift (KEY_LEFTSHIFT, KEY_RIGHTSHIFT), ctrl (KEY_LEFTCTRL, ...),
#	alt, etc. You can combine up to three modifier keys together with
#	a keycode. You can even combine them with mouse button events.
#	You do not need to specify any mod keys if you don't need to.
#
#	command: this describes the command you want to execute when
#	pressing a button. First, you must specify the location of
#	the file (full path and name). You may then specify any program
#	specific arguments. Example:
#		command = /usr/bin/gedit --new-window /etc/btnx/btnx_config
#	This will open gedit in a new window and open this configuration
#	file.
#
#	uid: this is the UID (User IDentifier) of the user that executes
#	the command. You should probably execute commands with your UID.
#	You can get your UID by typing:
#		$ echo $UID
#	in your terminal. 
#	##############!!WARNING!!!###############
#	If you do not specify a UID, btnx will execute
#	the program with the same privileges as btnx (root, uid=0).
#	Do this ONLY if you _must_ have root privileges to execute
#	something. Use common sense. It's not too smart to have root
#	privileges on your mouse button.
#
#	Go ahead and specify a Button section for each one of your
#	mouse buttons. Use the example configurations below as a
#	reference.
